# Uncertainty-Estimation-using-Bayesian-Approximation

In this work, we estimate the posterior predictive distribution using Monte Carlo dropout during trajectory
forecasting for pedestrians. Our probabilistic model using MC dropout outperforms previous deterministic 
methods in terms of perfromance metrics like ADE and FDE.


##### Sample Trajectoy prediction with uncertainty. As per literature, we observe 8 (3.2 secs) historical steps to predict 12 steps (4.8 secs) into future.
