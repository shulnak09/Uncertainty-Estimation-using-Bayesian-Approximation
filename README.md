# Uncertainty-Estimation-using-Bayesian-Approximation

In this work, we estimate the posterior predictive distribution using Monte Carlo dropout during trajectory
forecasting for pedestrians. Our probabilistic model using MC dropout outperforms previous deterministic 
methods in terms of perfromance metrics like ADE and FDE.
